What are some quotes about hope and dreams?,"['“only once in your life, i truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. you tell them things that youâ€™ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. you share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. when something wonderful happens, you canâ€™t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. they are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. there is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. you can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. the things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid itâ€™s like being young again. colours seem brighter and more brilliant. laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didnâ€™t exist at all. a phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long dayâ€™s work and always brings a smile to your face. in their presence, thereâ€™s no need for continuous conversation, but you find youâ€™re quite content in just having them nearby. things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. you think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. you open your heart knowing that thereâ€™s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. you find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure thatâ€™s so real it scares you. you find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”', '“he awoke each morning with the desire to do right, to be a good and meaningful person, to be, as simple as it sounded and as impossible as it actually was, happy. and during the course of each day his heart would descend from his chest into his stomach. by early afternoon he was overcome by the feeling that nothing was right, or nothing was right for him, and by the desire to be alone. by evening he was fulfilled: alone in the magnitude of his grief, alone in his aimless guilt, alone even in his loneliness. i am not sad, he would repeat to himself over and over, i am not sad. as if he might one day convince himself. or fool himself. or convince others--the only thing worse than being sad is for others to know that you are sad. i am not sad. i am not sad. because his life had unlimited potential for happiness, insofar as it was an empty white room. he would fall asleep with his heart at the foot of his bed, like some domesticated animal that was no part of him at all. and each morning he would wake with it again in the cupboard of his rib cage, having become a little heavier, a little weaker, but still pumping. and by the midafternoon he was again overcome with the desire to be somewhere else, someone else, someone else somewhere else. i am not sad.”', ""“it doesn't interest me what you do for a living. i want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.it doesn't interest me how old you are. i want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. it doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. i want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain!i want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it. i want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. it doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. i want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithlessand therefore trustworthy. i want to know if you can see beauty even when it's not pretty, every day,and if you can source your own life from its presence. i want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, â€œyes!â€�it doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. i want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. it doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. i want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. it doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. i want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. i want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.”""]","These quotes touch on the importance of sharing hopes and dreams with someone who understands and supports you, and daring to dream and pursue your heart's longings despite potential setbacks or fears.",1.0,0.5742835705241517

Quotes related to perseverance and overcoming adversity.,"[""“perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.first is the door of sleep. sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. when a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. this is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.second is the door of forgetting. some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. in addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. the saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. time heals most wounds. the rest are hidden behind this door.third is the door of madness. there are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. while this may not seem beneficial, it is. there are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. last is the door of death. the final resort. nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.”"", '“look again at that dot. that\'s here. that\'s home. that\'s us. on it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. the aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,

dust suspended in a sunbeam.the earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. in our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.the earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. there is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. visit, yes. settle, not yet. like it or not, for the moment the earth is where we make our stand.it has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. to me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to
